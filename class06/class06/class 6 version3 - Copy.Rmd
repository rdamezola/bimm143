# About
this is my **class 6** r markdown doc with my *code* and notes for the day.

```{r}

## reading in files practice

There are 3 files to read.
```{r}
read.table("test1.txt", header=TRUE, sep=",")


```

```{r}
read.table("test2.txt", header=TRUE, sep=",")
```

```{r}
read.table("test3.txt", header=TRUE, sep=",")
```
